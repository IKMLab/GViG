# Pretrained Weights

## Purpose
This folder contains pretrained weights for various models used in our project. These weights serve as a starting point for training and fine-tuning models for specific tasks.

## Contents
- `ofa_huge.pt`: Pretrained weights for OFA-Huge.
- `ofa_large.pt`: Pretrained weights for OFA-Large.
- `ofa_base.pt`: Pretrained weights for OFA-Base.
- `ofa_medium.pt`: Pretrained weights for OFA-Medium.
- `ofa_tiny.pt`: Pretrained weights for OFA-Tiny.

## Usage
To use these pretrained weights, load them using the appropriate framework and model architecture.
